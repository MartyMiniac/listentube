## What is it ?
It is quite frustating when you want to jus here just a youtube video. Think about a music video of which you just want to here the music or a podcast of which you just want voice and no video stream. So here is the deal! How about streaming just audio and no video and if you like it why not download it from the same place. This is a heroku deployable webserver based on flask which accepts youtube url as requests and returns you an audio streaming page where you can stream the audio.
